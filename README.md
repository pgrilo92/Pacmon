# Pacmon

## Intro

In this project I will be recreating my own version of the classic game Pacman. I will call it Pacmon

## Set Up

1. This game will include the main character Pacmon
2. Four ghosts
3. The standard gamebox for pacman
4. Local Sprites will be available

## Instructions

- The arrow keys will be available in order to change the direction of Pacmon
- Goal is to eat all the coins available
- Eating the bigger coins will temporarily enable the ghosts to be eaten by turning them to blue
- Stay away! Ghosts will take Pacmon's life if in contact
- Pacmon will be given 3 lives
- Cherries might pop up randomly which will give Pacmon an extra life

### Pulling
Code will be available for anyone to pull.

Enjoy!!!!
